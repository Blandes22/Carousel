#Tribute-page
Normally, a tribute page should be about a person, but for me, I feel that this is much more suited to myself. While I have been gaming for my entire life Sekiro really set a standard for what a game should be in my eyes.
This is a project based off the first project from the 'Responsive Web Design' course at freecodecamp(dot)org. My main focus for this project was getting the carousel to work properly. Normally it wouldn't have been too hard but because I was not just making an image carousel it became much harder to work on.
