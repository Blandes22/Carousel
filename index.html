                            Japan is fractured into many independent nations entangled in ceaseless war.
                            Beyond endless snowy peaks lies the land of Ashina - a realm rife with sacred earth and
                            ancient
                            mystery.
                            For years the Ashina were overrun by invaders and forced to serve foreign lords.<br><br>

                            That is until twenty years ago, when Sword Saint Isshin Ashina ignited a bloody coup to
                            retake
                            his homeland. Isshin's skill with a blade was unrivaled, and he inspired fierce loyalty in
                            his
                            countrymen. Under his leadership Ashina was reclaimed by it's rightful rulers and a new time
                            of
                            peace began.
                            But now, Ashina once again faces an invasive threat. One more powerful than any before
                            it.<br><br>

                            The Interior Ministry has set it's sights on Ashina and will stop at nothing to unify all of
                            Japan under one banner. Genichiro Ashina, Isshin's grandson, has assumed command and
                            desperately
                            searches for a means to defend his home.
                            Soon though, he realizes the inevitable: “Ashina cannot be defended by normal means, not
                            anymore.”<br><br>

                            And so the Divine Heir is kidnapped,<br><br>

                            alone in the world save for a single shinobi.<br><br>
                            His loyal wolf - Sekiro.<br><br>

                            This is a tale of a Lord and his Retainer, and their journey to return balance to the land.

                            Development of Sekiro began in late 2015 following the completion of Bloodborne's 
                            downloadable content,
                            The Old Hunters. The game was revealed via a teaser trailer at The Game Awards 2017 in
                            December, showing
                            the tagline "Shadows Die Twice". The game's full title was revealed to be Sekiro: Shadows
                            Die Twice during
                            Microsoft's press conference at E3 2018. It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki of the
                            Japanese development studio
                            FromSoftware, best known for creating the Souls series and Bloodborne. The game was
                            published by Activision
                            worldwide, with FromSoftware self-publishing it in Japan and Cube Game publishing in the
                            Asia-Pacific region.
                            Sekiro's soundtrack was composed by Yuka Kitamura, with some contributions from Noriyuki
                            Asakura. The game
                            was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on 22 March 2019. A collectors edition
                            was also
                            released the same day, and included a steelbook case, a figurine of the protagonist, an art
                            book, a physical
                            map of the game's world, a download code for the soundtrack, and in-game coin replicas. A
                            port for Stadia
                            was released in late 2020.<br><br>

                            Sekiro draws inspiration from the Tenchu series of stealth-action games that were partially
                            developed and
                            published by FromSoftware. The team initially considered developing the game as a sequel to
                            Tenchu. However,
                            as that series had already been shaped by several different studios before they obtained the
                            rights to it,
                            they instead opted to take the project in a different direction. Miyazaki intended the
                            combat changes to
                            capture the feel of "swords clashing", with fighters trying to create an opening to deliver
                            the fatal strike.
                            He and the team also created the game to be an entirely single-player experience, as they
                            believed multiplayer
                            to have limitations they wanted to avoid.

                            Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an action-adventure game played from a third-person view.
                            Compared to
                            FromSoftware's Souls series, the game features fewer role-playing elements, lacking
                            character creation
                            and the ability to level up a variety of stats, as well as having no multiplayer elements.
                            It does, however, include gear upgrading, a skill tree, and limited ability customization.
                            Rather than
                            attacking to whittle an enemy's health points, combat in Sekiro revolves around using a
                            katana to attack
                            their posture and balance instead, which eventually leads to an opening that allows for a
                            single killing blow.
                            <br><br><br><br>
                            The game also features stealth elements, allowing players to instantly eliminate some
                            enemies if they can
                            get in range undetected. In addition, the player character can use various tools to assist
                            with combat and
                            exploration, such as a grappling hook. If the player character dies, they have the option of
                            being revived on
                            the spot if they have resurrection power, which is restored by defeating enemies, instead of
                            respawning at
                            earlier checkpoints.
